				The weapon has 2 charges and regains all expended charges
				daily at dawn or when an attack made with the dagger kills a
				beast or humanoid. When attacking with this weapon, you
				may spend a charge before the attack roll to add 1d4 fire
				damage to the damage roll.

				Curse. This dagger is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until
				you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic.
				Removing the dagger fails to end the curse on you. You have
				an insatiable appetite and must consume twice as much as
				before. You have also developed a particular taste for trogg
				flesh.
